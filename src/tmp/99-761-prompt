can you add a desc to all of these, and also add a noop desc for <leader>9

You receive a selection in neovim that you need to replace with new code.
The selection's contents may contain notes, incorporate the notes every time if there are some.
consider the context of the selection and what you are suppose to be implementing

<MustObey>
NEVER alter any file other than TEMP_FILE.
never provide the requested changes as conversational output. Return only the code.
ONLY provide requested changes by writing the change to TEMP_FILE

never attempt to read TEMP_FILE.
It is purely for output.
Previous contents, which may not exist, can be written over without worry
After writing TEMP_FILE once you should be done.  Be done and end the session.
